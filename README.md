# cryptopals
My solutions to the cryptopals challenge sets.

Note that this code is intended for educational purposes only. It is not designed to actually be used for any real world cryptography.

If you want to implement AES from scratch like I did in challenge 7, I would highly recommend reading the [original FIPS-197 document](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/197/final/documents/fips-197.pdf). It's actually really good.
